Welcome to the Redux Sonnet documentation!

Redux Sonnet is a side-effect management system for Redux which takes
inspiration from learnings in usage of both
[**`redux-observable`**][redux-observable] and [**Redux-Saga**][redux-saga]. The
powerful [Effect][effect-intro] library is leveraged to enrich patterns found in
both of these systems.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Safe**  | Understand where errors can occur and handle failure scenarios with ease. |
| **Declarative** | Be explicitly implicit about branching code. |
| **Familiar** | Principles and patterns from well-known libraries carry over with new life. |
