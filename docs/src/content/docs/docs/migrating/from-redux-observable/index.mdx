The `Stanza` module is meant to provide an analogue to RxJS Observable-based
usage.

Please read the [`Stanza` API documentation](/api/Stanzats.html) and the
[`redux-observable` unit test
ports](https://github.com/ehegnes/redux-sonnet/blob/main/packages/redux-sonnet/test/redux-observable.test.ts) for additional details.
