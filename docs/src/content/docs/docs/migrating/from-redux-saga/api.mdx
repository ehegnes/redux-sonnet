## Effect creators
### [`take(pattern)`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api#takepattern)
<details>
<summary>Original Reference</summary>
Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified action on the Store.
The Generator is suspended until an action that matches `pattern` is dispatched.

The result of `yield take(pattern)` is an action object being dispatched.

`pattern` is interpreted using the following rules:

- If `take` is called with no arguments or `'*'` all dispatched actions are matched (e.g. `take()` will match all actions)

- If it is a function, the action is matched if `pattern(action)` is true (e.g. `take(action => action.entities)` will match all actions having a (truthy) `entities` field.)
> Note: if the pattern function has `toString` defined on it, `action.type` will be tested against `pattern.toString()` instead. This is useful if you're using an action creator library like redux-act or redux-actions.

- If it is a String, the action is matched if `action.type === pattern` (e.g. `take(INCREMENT_ASYNC)`)

- If it is an array, each item in the array is matched with aforementioned rules, so the mixed array of strings and function predicates is supported. The most common use case is an array of strings though, so that `action.type` is matched against all items in the array (e.g. `take([INCREMENT, DECREMENT])` and that would match either actions of type `INCREMENT` or `DECREMENT`).

The middleware provides a special action `END`. If you dispatch the END action, then all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will be terminated regardless of the specified pattern. If the terminated Saga has still some forked tasks which are still running, it will wait for all the child tasks to terminate before terminating the Task.

<details>
<summary>Original Reference</summary>
Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a previously forked task.

- `task: Task` - A [Task](#task) object returned by a previous `fork`

#### Notes

To cancel a running task, the middleware will invoke `return` on the underlying Generator
object. This will cancel the current Effect in the task and jump to the finally block (if defined).

Inside the finally block, you can execute any cleanup logic or dispatch some action to keep the
store in a consistent state (e.g. reset the state of a spinner to false when an ajax request
is cancelled). You can check inside the finally block if a Saga was cancelled by issuing
a `yield cancelled()`.

Cancellation propagates downward to child sagas. When cancelling a task, the middleware will also
cancel the current Effect (where the task is currently blocked). If the current Effect
is a call to another Saga, it will be also cancelled. When cancelling a Saga, all *attached
forks* (sagas forked using `yield fork()`) will be cancelled. This means that cancellation
effectively affects the whole execution tree that belongs to the cancelled task.

`cancel` is a non-blocking Effect. i.e. the Saga executing it will resume immediately after
performing the cancellation.

For functions which return Promise results, you can plug your own cancellation logic
by attaching a `[CANCEL]` to the promise.

The following example shows how to attach cancellation logic to a Promise result:

```javascript
import { CANCEL } from 'redux-saga'
import { fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'

function myApi() {
  const promise = myXhr(...)

  promise[CANCEL] = () => myXhr.abort()
  return promise
}

function* mySaga() {

  const task = yield fork(myApi)

  // ... later
  // will call promise[CANCEL] on the result of myApi
  yield cancel(task)
}
```

redux-saga will automatically cancel jqXHR objects using their `abort` method.

/// <reference types="effect" />
// @paths: {"redux-sonnet": ["../packages/redux-sonnet/src"], "redux-sonnet/*": ["../packages/redux-sonnet/src/*"]}
// ---cut---
import { Effect, Fiber } from 'effect'

declare const myApi: Effect.Effect<void, never, never>

const mySaga = Effect.gen(function*() {
  const task = yield* Effect.fork(myApi)
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(task)
})

```

### [`cancel([...tasks])`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api#canceltasks)
### [`cancel()`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api#cancel)
### [`select(selector, ...args)`]()
<details>
<summary>Original Reference</summary>
Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to invoke the provided selector on the
current Store's state (i.e. returns the result of `selector(getState(), ...args)`).

- `selector: Function` - a function `(state, ...args) => args`. It takes the
current state and optionally some arguments and returns a slice of the current Store's state

- `args: Array<any>` - optional arguments to be passed to the selector in addition of `getState`.

If `select` is called without argument (i.e. `yield select()`) then the effect is resolved
with the entire state (the same result of a `getState()` call).

> It's important to note that when an action is dispatched to the store, the middleware first
forwards the action to the reducers and then notifies the Sagas. This means that when you query the
Store's State, you get the State **after** the action has been applied.
> However, this behavior is only guaranteed if all subsequent middlewares call `next(action)` synchronously.  If any subsequent middleware calls `next(action)` asynchronously (which is unusual but possible), then the sagas will get the state from **before** the action is applied.  Therefore it is recommended to review the source of each subsequent middleware to ensure it calls `next(action)` synchronously, or else ensure that redux-saga is the last middleware in the call chain.

#### Notes

Preferably, a Saga should be autonomous and should not depend on the Store's state. This makes
it easy to modify the state implementation without affecting the Saga code. A saga should preferably
depend only on its own internal control state when possible. But sometimes, one could
find it more convenient for a Saga to query the state instead of maintaining the needed data by itself
(for example, when a Saga duplicates the logic of invoking some reducer to compute a state that was
already computed by the Store).

For example, suppose we have this state shape in our application:

```javascript
state = {
  cart: {...}
}
```

We can create a *selector*, i.e. a function which knows how to extract the `cart` data from the State:

`./selectors`
```javascript
export const getCart = state => state.cart
```

Then we can use that selector from inside a Saga using the `select` Effect:

`./sagas.js`
```javascript
import { take, fork, select } from 'redux-saga/effects'
import { getCart } from './selectors'

function* checkout() {
  // query the state using the exported selector
  const cart = yield select(getCart)

  // ... call some API endpoint then dispatch a success/error action
}

export default function* rootSaga() {
  while (true) {
    yield take('CHECKOUT_REQUEST')
    yield fork(checkout)
  }
}
```

`checkout` can get the needed information directly by using `select(getCart)`. The Saga is coupled only with the `getCart` selector. If we have many Sagas (or React Components) that needs to access the `cart` slice, they will all be coupled to the same function `getCart`. And if we now change the state shape, we need only to update `getCart`.
